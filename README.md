# First HTML Exercises

## The Repository
Hi there! This repository will hold some files where I practice basic HTML. When I say basic I mean BASIC :laughing: These mini projects are based on previous exercises/homework assignments I did with UNCC's Bootcamp Certificate Program. Due to the craziness of life, the state of the world, crazy job hours, and health issues (hey that's what happens when you get older), I went on a long extended period of not coding. However, I'm excited to swing back into the world of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other exciting languages. Be on the lookout for more repositories where I will be doing tons of mini projects!

###  Hello World Exercise
This screenshot is for the hello world exercise I did. Very basic but it's there!

### Fanpage for a Band (I made it for an Anime instead) Exercise
Doesn't the fanpage remind you of what a geocities website page would look like back in the 90s? Coincidentally, Sailor Moon premiered in the US during the mid 90s (correct me on this if I'm wrong) as well! It wasn't too hard to go for that geocities look lol. I will admit, I have a soft spot for the geocities era since it was my first experience with website building.

### Student Bio Exercise 
This is the example UNCC had for students to replicate.

Here is what I created; inspired by Sanrio's Pompompurin mascot and my love for Flan. I call this look, after Geocities but before Wordpress LOL.
