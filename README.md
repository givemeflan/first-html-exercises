## First HTML Exercises

## The Repository
Hi there! This repository will hold some files (3) where I practice HTML. There are 3 files for 3 basic HTML exercises. These exercises are based on previous exercises I did with UNCC's Bootcamp Certificate Program. It has been a while since I have last coded (job, life, Corona Virus, etc.), so I need to get back into the swing of things! If my code looks rather rudimentary I do apologize. I'm re-learning how to code again ^_^ 

## Exercise List 
* 1.) Hello World Exercise 
* 2.) Fanpage for a band (in my example, I decided to do it after an anime I watched when I was a kid) 
* 3.) Student Bio 

## Hello World Exercise
This screenshot is for the hello world exercise.
