# First HTML Exercises

## The Repository
Hi there! This repository will hold some files where I practice basic HTML. These "mini-projects/homework" are based on previous exercises I did with UNCC's Bootcamp Certificate Program. It has been a while since I have last coded (job, life, Corona Virus, etc.), so I decided why not practice coding by doing all of these exercises again! If my code looks rather rudimentary I do apologize. I'm relearning everything again ^_^ 

### Exercise List 
* Hello World Exercise 
* Fanpage for a Band (in my example, I decided to do it after an anime I watched when I was a kid) 
* Student Bio 

### Hello World Exercise
This screenshot is for the hello world exercise I did. Very basic but it's there!

### Fanpage for a Band (I made it for an Anime instead) Exercise
Doesn't the fanpage remind you of what a geocities website page would look like back in the 90s? Coincidentally, Sailor Moon premiered in the 90s as well! It wasn't too hard to go for that geocities look lol. I will admit, I have a soft spot for the geocities era since it was my first experience with website building.

### Student Bio Exercise 
This is the example UNCC had for students to replicate.

Here is what I created; inspired by Sanrio's Pompompurin mascot and my love for Flan. I call this look, after Geocities but before Wordpress LOL.
