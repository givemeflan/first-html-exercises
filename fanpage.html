    <h2>About the Anime</h2>
    <p>
        Sailor Moon (美少女戦士セーラームーン, Bishōjo Senshi Sērā Mūn, originally translated as Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon[1] and
        later as Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon[2][3]) is a Japanese shōjo manga series written and illustrated by Naoko
        Takeuchi. The series follows the adventures of a schoolgirl named Usagi Tsukino as she transforms into Sailor
        Moon to search for a magical artifact, the "Legendary Silver Crystal" (「幻の銀水晶」, Maboroshi no Ginzuishō, lit.
        "Phantom Silver Crystal"). She leads a group of comrades, the Sailor Soldiers (セーラー戦士, Sērā Senshi) (Sailor
        Guardians in later editions) as they battle against villains to prevent the theft of the Silver Crystal and the
        destruction of the Solar System. - Grabbed from Wikipedia, see more at this link <a
